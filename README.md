Things that probably won't be done:
--------
These are things I wouldn't want to be playing with on an idle whim on my phone as the impact of a mistake would be quite large.

If people think it's a good idea then let me know @NetworkString and I'll add them

* Delete environments
* Delete Role
* Delete Node
* Delete Recipe
* Recipe from file - too much data to be sending over HSPDA / creating on the phone even with access to an SDCard
